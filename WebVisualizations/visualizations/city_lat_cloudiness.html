    <p>
      Each dot in this scatter plot represents a city; its location is determined by its latitude along the x-axis and its percentage of cloudiness along the y-axis. Based on the plot, 
      there appears to be no relationship between a city's latitude and cloudiness. This was expected since there are many factors that go into how cloudy a location may be such as wind speed, humidity 
      and environmental factors. This was also the most difficult of all plots to determine visually whether or not there were outliers because the plot points were so scattered.</p>
