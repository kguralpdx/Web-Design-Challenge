    <p>Each dot in this scatter plot represents a city; its location is determined by its latitude along the x-axis and its wind speed along the y-axis. Based on the plot, there does seem to be a linear relationship 
      between the variables but it's not positive or negative, more flat, and there are potential outliers. It does show some grouping of points toward the bottom of the plot and is somewhat linear in shape but 
      it's still pretty scattered so no relationship.</p>
