    <p>Each dot in this scatter plot represents a city; its location is determined by its latitude along the x-axis and its maximum temperature in degrees Fahrenheit along the y-axis. Based on the shape of the plot, 
      these two variables have a moderate to strong curvalinear relationship with a few potential outliers. The closer a city was to the equator, it was likely that its temperature would be warmer than a city farther 
      from the equator. Of all the data points compared, this was the only pair of variables that showed strong potential for further analysis.</p>
