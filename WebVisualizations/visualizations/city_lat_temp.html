          <p>Each dot in this scatter plot represents a city; its location is determined by its latitude along the x-axis and its maximum temperature in Fahrenheit along the y-axis. Based on the shape of the plot, 
              these two variables have a moderate to strong non-linear relationship with a few potential outliers.</p>
