    <p>Each dot in this scatter plot represents a city; its location is determined by its latitude along the x-axis and its humidity along the y-axis. Based on the plot, there appears to be a weak relationship at 
      best between where a city is located and its humidity. This is not surprising since a place in the Midwest like Detroit, Michigan, is pretty humid in the summer whereas Phoenix, Arizona, closer to the Equator, has 
    low humidity.</p>
