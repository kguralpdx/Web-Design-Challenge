# Weather Data Revisited through the Power of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

## Overview

In order to put newly acquired HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills to good use, a website was created taking advantage of weather data and scatter plots created in a previous challenge. This website needed a landing page, 4 visualization pages, a data page to show the underlying data, and a comparison page so all 4 scatter plots could be viewed at once. Navigation was also included by way of a top navigation bar with links and a dropdown list and a sidebar of visualization thumbnails. All of this needed to work on various size screens from a smartphone up to a desktop monitor. 

Then as a bonus, further analysis of the temperature and precipitation data is performed.
