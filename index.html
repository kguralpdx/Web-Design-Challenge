    <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes are you get closer to the equator. To do this analysis, a random sampling of weather condition data from at least 500 cities from around the world was taken using 
      the <em>OpenWeatherMap API</em>. From that dataset, four weather conditions--maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed--were then compared with the cities' latitudes through <em>Matplotlib</em> scatter plots to 
      determine if they can predict what the weather will be like.</p>

      <p>This site provides the source data extracted, the visualizations created, and the findings of the analysis.</p>
